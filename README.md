Tools for working with the FamilySearch Family Tree at familysearch.org

FamilySearch Family Tree is a free genealogical service provided by the The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.  I have no relationship to that organization other than using their service.

Tools I have created for FamilySearch:
Person ID - Given a FamilySearch person ID, opens a person's page
Refresh - Given a FamilySearch person ID, opens a person's page. If you are already on a person page it will refresh it
Hint Chart - Opens the person's hint chart 
Find-a-Grave - Given a Find-a-Grave ID, determines if record is associated with a person in FamilySearch
Merge - a faster way to merge people in FamilySearch
Tree - opens a person's tree page
Sources - opens a person's sources page
XML - opens a person's profile as XML (or JSON)

Related tools I have created:
